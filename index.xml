This system is defined by a reference path, such as a driving lane. As an showcase example, the delay times and distances between vehicles in a roundabout setting are analyzed. The trajectories recorded in the OpenDD dataset are used. In the end of the post, the reader will understand the benefits of Frenet-Serret frames compared to a conventional metric approach when it comes to trajectory analysis in a real world setting.</description></item><item><title>Wrap C++ algorithms in Python for pre-production evaluation and experimentation.</title><link>https://kopytjuk.github.io/posts/wrapping-cpp-algorithms/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Sep 2021 11:19:40 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://kopytjuk.github.io/posts/wrapping-cpp-algorithms/</guid><description>TLDR; In model based design paradigm one often implements a proof-of-concept solution in a scripting language before porting the logic to a more performant low-level language like C/C++. This article describes the benefits of calling production-ready (C/C++) ports in Python for functional evaluation and analysis. Assessment tools developed previously during the experimentation stage can be reused. Furthermore, the complexity for experimentation with various internal parameters is reduced, which can optimize costs and expensive debugging prior to the final deployment.</description></item><item><title>[Medium] From C to machine code — demystifying CPU mechanics</title><link>https://kopytjuk.github.io/posts/from-c-to-machine/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Dec 2019 18:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://kopytjuk.github.io/posts/from-c-to-machine/</guid><description>Read the article on Medium.</description></item><item><title>[Medium] Simulating non-linear dynamic systems with Python</title><link>https://kopytjuk.github.io/posts/simulating-dynamic-systems/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Nov 2019 18:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://kopytjuk.github.io/posts/simulating-dynamic-systems/</guid><description>Read the article on Medium.</description></item><item><title>[Medium] On Understanding of Central Limit Theorem (visually)</title><link>https://kopytjuk.github.io/posts/central-limit-theorem/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Oct 2019 18:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://kopytjuk.github.io/posts/central-limit-theorem/</guid><description>Read the article on Medium.</description></item><item><title>[Medium] Sum of two random variables or the rocky path to understanding convolutions of probability distributions</title><link>https://kopytjuk.github.io/posts/sum-two-rand-vars/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Oct 2019 18:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://kopytjuk.github.io/posts/sum-two-rand-vars/</guid><description>Read the article on Medium.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://kopytjuk.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kopytjuk.github.io/about/</guid><description>My name is Marat, I was born in the early 90&amp;rsquo;s in Witebsk (Belarus), currently work and live in Heilbronn (South Germany). I studied mechatronics for Bachelor. and automated driving for Masters degree. My mother language is Russian, but over the time the available vocabulary in German and English got more advanced.
I count myself as an interdisciplinary developer who believes that combining cross-domain expertise in mechatronical systems, robotics, software engineering, cloud and probability theory is essential towards inspiring, efficient, future-proof and reliable products.</description></item></channel></rss>
