title: "About"
---

My name is Marat, I was born in the early 90's in Witebsk (Belarus), currently work and live in Heilbronn (South Germany). I studied mechatronics for Bachelors, and Automated Driving for Masters degree.

I see myself as an interdisciplinary developer who believes that combining cross-domain expertise in mechatronical systems, robotics, software engineering, cloud and probability theory is essential towards inspiring, efficient, future-proof and reliable products.

I enjoy teaching, insightful visualizations and well written books. In my free time I like to spend time on the couch after a run, watch movies and
(when there is time left) play RPG videogames.
